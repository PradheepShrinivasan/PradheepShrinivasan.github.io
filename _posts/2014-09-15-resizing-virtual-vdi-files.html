<br />Recently i was trying to resize the vmdk files of my ubuntu installation on virtual box on mac.<br /><br />My installation was running out of space and it was necessary that i increase the space.<br /><br />Naive of me to have thought that the size shown in the during creation of my setup was the initial size and virtual box would magically keep on growing the size forever :(<br /><br />I had only 8GB and installing the kernel source code 2 branches did fill up my hard disk.<br /><br />So i had to resize and after reading the internet for a good one hour, i was able to track a site that provides accurate information of what to do.<br /><br />It works beautifully and below link is <a href="http://trivialproof.blogspot.ca/2011/01/resizing-virtualbox-virtual-hard-disk.html">http://trivialproof.blogspot.ca/2011/01/resizing-virtualbox-virtual-hard-disk.html</a><br /><br />Have fun, its simple and there is nothing much that can go wrong. If you want to be sure, make sure to take a copy of the virtual box files :)
