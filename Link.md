##Linux Kernel Programming

1. The Kernel building from the source  and learn it from scratch the best page to look forward is [crashcourse.ca] (http://www.crashcourse.ca/introduction-linux-kernel-programming/lesson-1-building-and-running-new-linux-kernel). 


## Virtual Machines

1. My favourite virtual machine manager for windows is [vmware player](http://www.vmware.com/products/player). Its must if you are going to try linux or any other operating system.
2. [Virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is the only free virtual machine manager available for mac. I love it :).
3. Resizing the virtual disks is very common as you could run out of space or as we make a mistake. Now worries this [blog](http://trivialproof.blogspot.ca/2011/01/resizing-virtualbox-virtual-hard-disk.html) gives you a step by step instructions of how to do it.
