##Linux Kernel Programming

1. The Kernel building from the source  and learn it from scratch the best page to look forward is [crashcourse.ca] (http://www.crashcourse.ca/introduction-linux-kernel-programming/lesson-1-building-and-running-new-linux-kernel). 

## Virtual Machines

1. My favourite virtual machine manager for windows is [vmware player](http://www.vmware.com/products/player). Its must if you are going to try linux or any other operating system.
2. [Virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is the only free virtual machine manager available for mac. I love it :).
3. Resizing the virtual disks is very common as you could run out of space or as we make a mistake. Now worries this [blog](http://trivialproof.blogspot.ca/2011/01/resizing-virtualbox-virtual-hard-disk.html) gives you a step by step instructions of how to do it.
4. The best guide to learning about time keeping in VM read [here](http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/Timekeeping-In-VirtualMachines.pdf)

## Jekyll

1. Getting comments, Analytics,  working with jekyll [here](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/)
2. The blog markup of jekyll is redcarpet that git also uses. So all markup can be found in git site [here] (https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/)

##Git 

###Learning git
1. Udacity has a good course on getting started with git 
2. If you want to become an expert with handson excercises by using git look [here] ()

## Performance 

1.Single reader single write queue optimization [here](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6163-high-performance-single-producer-single-consumer-in-memory-queue)

## MAC

1.if you are new to make and finder that the finder is lacking in options compared to that of the windows like creating a new file. This is a must but hey apple thinks its not needed. So the easiest way is to use an application called [xtrafinder](http://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/).Its cool as it allows you to create tabs in finder, your own shortcuts and so on. Just  try it out.

2.Similar to the package management software in linux distributions like apt,rpm which helps to install all open source packages, the macos equivalent is [brew](http://brew.sh/). Its a must if you are a developer of unix.

## Database

If you are one of the few who loves how databases work and debunk their claim of their product look at this [blog](https://aphyr.com/)
